This project focuses on predicting mechanical and corrosion properties of materials based on their chemical composition and processing parameters using various regression models.
The models used include Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regressors. 
The dataset is processed, normalized, and used to evaluate the models' performances using multiple metrics such as MSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
